The Harrow–Hassidim–Lloyd (HHL) algorithm is a quantum algorithm designed for solving systems of linear equations. It estimates the result of a scalar measurement on the solution vector to a given linear system of equations. One of its key features is the ability to provide an exponential speedup over classical algorithms for linear systems with low condition numbers. However, the HHL algorithm typically involves quantum circuits of higher depth due to the use of Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE). QPE is a important quantum computing subroutine that play a crucial role in various quantum application, but it can be challenging to implement QPEs on near-term quantum hardware.
